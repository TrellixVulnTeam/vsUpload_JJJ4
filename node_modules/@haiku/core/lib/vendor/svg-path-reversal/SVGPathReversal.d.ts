 * Reverse an SVG path.
 * As long as the input path is normalised, this is actually really
 * simple to do. As all pathing commands are symmetrical, meaning
 * that they render the same when you reverse the coordinate order,
 * the grand trick here is to reverse the path (making sure to keep
 * coordinates ordered pairwise) and shift the operators left by
 * one or two coordinate pairs depending on the operator:
 *
 *   - Z disappears,
 *   - M becomes Z,
 *   - L moves to 2 spots earlier (skipping one coordinate),
 *   - Q moves to 2 spots earlier (skipping one coordinate),
 *   - C moves to 4 spots earlier (skipping two coordinates),
 *   - the path start must become M.
