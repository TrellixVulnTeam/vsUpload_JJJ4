a complex system of\n                social media companies, websites, apps, and ad tech firms has\n                been amassing increasingly frightening amounts of personal data\n                that powers a $227 billion-a-year industry. At the center of\n                this are most big tech companies we have become dependent on.\n                However, outliers remain; while major tech players like Google\n                and Facebook have a business model centered around the\n                collection and sale of user data in order to offer a range of\n                mostly free services; Apple has a different strategy. By\n                focusing on device, software and subscription sales they are\n                able to treat users as the customer instead of product and\n                prioritize privacy. The transparency and control of how user’s\n                digital information is treated has always been a core value of\n                the company,{\" \"}\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <blockquote>\n                <p>\n                  “I believe people are smart and some people want to share more\n                  data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make\n                  them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your\n                  asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do\n                  with their data.”\n                </p>\n                <p>-Steve Jobs</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>\n                but as concerns regarding big data become more prevalent and\n                controversial they have doubled down on their stance. Recent\n                software updates have introduced a variety of features intended\n                to enhance user privacy. As part of this examination we will use\n                Goldmans framework to evaluate the effectiveness of these\n                features in terms of the publics ability to acquire true beliefs\n                freely; but also consider how Apple’s stance is challenging\n                Goldmans suggestion that “protecting privacy usually leads to\n                less knowledge being acquired” (Fallis). Apple does not act as a\n                source of knowledge but the way in which their services change\n                how you access other services have an impact on how effectively\n                the user is able to obtain information. We will focus on effects\n                to the speed, effeciency and fecundity of how individuals\n                acquire information as a result of Apple’s protections and\n                insights for using 3rd party services on their hardware, as well\n                as their practices of anonymization to enable big data\n                processing without relying on specific information about the\n                individual.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n\n              <h1 id=\"Moral vs. Epistemic\">Moral vs. Epistemic</h1>\n              <p>\n                Before evaluating Apple’s values and policies in regard to\n                privacy we must first establish the relevance of privacy to the\n                field of Epistemology. Philosophers, including Goldman, have\n                argued that while morally important - the discussion of privacy\n                falls outside of the epistemic realm. In his words:{\" \"}\n              </p>\n              <blockquote>\n                <p>\n                  “epistemology focuses on the means to knowledge enhancement,\n                  whereas privacy studies focus on the means to knowledge\n                  curtailment… For this reason, I shall not explore this topic.\n                  I do not belittle the importance of privacy as a moral issue;\n                  it simply falls, for the most part, outside the scope of\n                  epistemology. (Goldman 1999: 173),\n                </p>\n              </blockquote>\n\n              <p>\n                I agree with much of Goldman’s work, and think his epistemic\n                objectives are an excellent framework for analysis, but this\n                flawed for two reasons. The practice of privacy would still be\n                epistemically consequential even if it was exclusively tied to\n                knowledge curtailment it would still be epistemically\n                consequential; and more importantly this understanding of\n                privacy is a broad generalization.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n\n              <h2 id=\"Bentham Panopticon\">Bentham Panopticon</h2>\n              <p>\n                Bentham’s concept of the ‘Panopticon’ is a fitting analogy for\n                the surveillance system that has developed through the use of\n                technology. In this scenario of a hypothetical prison the\n                central guard tower can see into any cell to see what is going\n                at their convenience; while the prisoners have no way of knowing\n                whether or not they are being watched at any given moment. In\n                the context of technology big tech companies like Google and\n                Facebook become the guards - with seemingly unlimited access to\n                any personal information at any time; while users are the\n                prisoners - having no knowledge about what aspects of their\n                online lives are being monitored; when and by whom. People will\n                limit how and what knowledge they acquire if always unsure who\n                is monitoring them and fearful of the consequences. In a 1991\n                paper philosopher Garoogian describes this as a ‘chilling\n                effect.’ This fear of being monitored makes people hesitant to\n                quire information they otherwise would have.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                With concerns about online privacy becoming more and more\n                prevalent today, the impact of this effect can be clearly seen.\n                According to a study by the National Cyber Security Alliance,\n                nearly 74% of Americans have limited their internet use due to\n                privacy concerns (TrustArc, National Cyber Security Alliance).{\" \"}\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Although we typically consider an “Epistemic Advesary”\n                detrimental to our acquisition of knowledge; this phenonmem\n                illustrates particular situations where they can be helpful. A\n                lack of privacy may become detrimental to the power efficiency\n                and reliability of the tools people, and adversaries protecting\n                your privacy help to protect that. In a 2013 paper titled\n                ‘Privacy and Lack of Knowledge’ Fallis brings up the the a\n                librarian as an effective example of how one of these\n                adversaries can be epistemically consequential:\n              </p>\n\n              <blockquote>\n                <p>\n                  “Librarians take very seriously the privacy of their patrons.\n                  Indeed, it is a core principle in their code of ethics (see\n                  Garoogian 1991 : 230). So, librarians will not release patron\n                  borrowing records without a subpoena. In addition, they set up\n                  library computers so that internet caches are automatically\n                  erased after each patron. Thus, a record of the websites that\n                  a patron has visited will not exist even if it is subpoenaed.\n                  There is certainly one respect in which such practices curtail\n                  knowledge acquisition. They involve withholding information\n                  from people who would like to know it. For instance, in their\n                  search for terrorists, the FBI would like to know which people\n                  are looking up information about bomb making, but library\n                  privacy measures make it more difficult for them to acquire\n                  this knowledge. However, such practices also make it more\n                  likely that library patrons will acquire knowledge on all\n                  sorts of topics. This is because, if people are worried that\n                  other people (such as FBI agents) can easily and out what\n                  books they have checked out, there can be a chilling effect on\n                  their use of libraries.\n                </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>\n                There is certainly a cost that comes with hiding information\n                when certain parties are looking for it, but as a result of\n                these librarians people can feel more free and confident knowing\n                exactly what information about them is being collected while\n                using the web and start to overcome this “chilling effect.”{\" \"}\n              </p>\n\n              <h2 id=\"Right to Privacy\">Right to Privacy</h2>\n              <p>\n                In order to preserve the indiviudal's online freedom we should\n                define the criteria that will help reduce this 'chilling\n                effect.' There are a number of different criteria that can be\n                used to determine the right to privacy; but to make things\n                easier we will focus these three basic 'rights' (Fallis).\n              </p>\n              <ol start=\"1\">\n                <li>Do not observe him</li>\n                <li>\n                  Do not to interfere with his control of his personal\n                  information\n                </li>\n                <li>Do not come to know his personal info</li>\n              </ol>\n              <h1 id=\"Taking Back Control\">Taking Back Control</h1>\n              <p>\n                Apple has certainly got a lot of attention for their recent\n                efforts in privacy; but by no means are they the first company\n                address this issue, nor did they pioneer the techniques they now\n                hope to bring to the masses.

By introducing a\n                calculated factor of randomness into data set, meaningful\n                insights can still be drawn from analysis while preventing\n                specific individuals from being identified or targeted. Each\n                user of Apple devices is allocated a ‘privacy budget’ for\n                different services they need to collect data on, and anonymized\n                information will only be shared until this threshold is met.\n                This improves the usability and convenience of features that\n                users may forget they rely on.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n              <h1 id=\"All things considered\"> All things considered</h1>\n              <h2 id=\"Fecundity\">Fecundity</h2>\n              <p>\n                However effective these practices may be; to perform a thorough\n                epistemic analysis we must consider to whom these epistemic\n                benefits are delivered, and if the diversity of this\n                distribution is problematic. Apple’s premium business model\n                means that only a segment of the population are able to afford\n                their devices, and benefit from the features they are providing.\n                A study by Forrester research found that the median household\n                income for Mac owners is $98,560 compared to $74,452 of Windows\n                PC owners, and similarly the median iPhone app user earns\n                $85,000 per year vs. $61,000 for Android phone users. This\n                distribution is certainly not ideal, and we should not overlook\n                the effects that this disparity can have; but in considering the\n                impact to the general population, I believe the Apple’s new\n                policies will have a net positive effect. The obfuscation\n                features they have introduced are not necessarily revolutionary\n                in terms of technology, but the public awareness of previous\n                solutions was low, and they typically required sacrifices in\n                terms of experience. Apples efforts to bring the capability to\n                controls to the broader public are so far unprecedented. In the\n                United States 46.9% of smartphone, and 27.3% of PC users own\n                their devices. Instead of having to seek it out; these tools are\n                presented by default and information about how data is being\n                used it proactively shown to all users of their devices. Beyond\n                this, giving such a large group of consumers the transparency\n                and choice to obfuscate the information that companies like\n                Google and Facebook rely on puts an enormous pressure on them to\n                reconsider their privacy policies and transparency with users.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n\n              <h2 id=\"h2\"> h2</h2>\n              <h3 id=\"h3\"> h3</h3>\n              <h4 id=\"h4\"> h4</h4>\n              <h5 id=\"h5\"> h5</h5>\n              <h6 id=\"h6\"> h6</h6>\n\n              <div class=\"csl-bib-body\">\n                <ul class=\"report combineChildItems\">\n                  <li id=\"item_3CSNC54A\" class=\"item journalArticle\">\n                    <h2>A Day in the Life of Your Data</h2>\n                    <table>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Type</th>\n                        <td>Journal Article</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Language</th>\n                        <td>en</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Library Catalog</th>\n                        <td>Zotero</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Pages</th>\n                        <td>13</td>\n                      </tr>\n                    </table>\n                    <h3 class=\"notes\">Notes:</h3>\n                    <ul class=\"notes\">\n                      <li id=\"item_AWXHG7Z4\">\n                        <div>\n                          <p>\n                            Article by Apple on how a users data is treated\n                            throughout a typical day.

In Knowledge in a Social World,\n                          Alvin Goldman has proposed an epistemic value theory\n                          that allows us to say whether one outcome is\n                          epistemically better than another. However, it has\n                          been suggested that Goldman’s theory is not really an\n                          epistemic value theory at all because whether one\n                          outcome is epistemically better than another partly\n                          depends on our non-epistemic interests. In this paper,\n                          I argue that an epistemic value theory that serves the\n                          purposes of social epistemology must incorporate\n                          nonepistemic interests in much the way that Goldman’s\n                          theory does. In fact, I argue that Goldman’s theory\n                          does not go far enough in this direction. In\n                          particular, the epistemic value of having a particular\n                          true belief should actually be weighted by how\n                          interested we are in the topic.\n                        </td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Date</th>\n                        <td>10/2006</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Language</th>\n                        <td>en</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Library Catalog</th>\n                        <td>DOI.org (Crossref)</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>URL</th>\n                        <td>\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S174236000000040X/type/journal_article\">\n                            https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S174236000000040X/type/journal_article\n                          </a>\n                        </td>\n                      </tr>\n\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Volume</th>\n                        <td>2</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Pages</th>\n                        <td>177-188</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Publication</th>\n                        <td>Episteme</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>DOI</th>\n                        <td>\n                          <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3366/epi.2005.2.3.177\">\n                            10.3366/epi.2005.2.3.177\n                          </a>\n                        </td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Issue</th>\n                        <td>3</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Journal Abbr</th>\n                        <td>Episteme</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>ISSN</th>\n                        <td>1742-3600, 1750-0117</td>\n                      </tr>\n                    </table>\n                    <h3 class=\"attachments\">Attachments</h3>\n                    <ul class=\"attachments\">\n                      <li id=\"item_L2NTCVKT\">\n                        Fallis - 2006 - Epistemic Value Theory and Social\n                        Epistemology.pdf{\" \"}\n                      </li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </li>\n\n                  <li id=\"item_83YSTFN8\" class=\"item journalArticle\">\n                    <h2>Foundations of social epistemics</h2>\n                    <table>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Type</th>\n                        <td>Journal Article</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th class=\"author\">Author</th>\n                        <td>Alvin I.

First, Alvin Goldman has\n                          suggested that protecting privacy typically leads to\n                          less knowledge being acquired. Second, several other\n                          philosophers (e.g. Parent, Matheson, Blaauw and Peels)\n                          have claimed that lack of knowledge is definitive of\n                          having privacy. In other words, someone not knowing\n                          something is necessary and sufficient for someone else\n                          having privacy about that thing. Or equivalently,\n                          someone knowing something is necessary and sufficient\n                          for someone else losing privacy about that thing. In\n                          this paper, I argue that both of these suggestions are\n                          incorrect. I begin by arguing, contra Goldman, that\n                          protecting privacy often leads to more knowledge being\n                          acquired. I argue in the remainder of the paper,\n                          contra the defenders of the knowledge account of\n                          privacy , that someone knowing something is not\n                          necessary for someone else losing privacy about that\n                          thing.\n                        </td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Date</th>\n                        <td>06/2013</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Language</th>\n                        <td>en</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Library Catalog</th>\n                        <td>DOI.org (Crossref)</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>URL</th>\n                        <td>\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1742360013000130/type/journal_article\">\n                            https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1742360013000130/type/journal_article\n                          </a>\n                        </td>\n                      </tr>\n\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Volume</th>\n                        <td>10</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Pages</th>\n                        <td>153-166</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Publication</th>\n                        <td>Episteme</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>DOI</th>\n                        <td>\n                          <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1017/epi.2013.13\">\n                            10.1017/epi.2013.13\n                          </a>\n                        </td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Issue</th>\n                        <td>2</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Journal Abbr</th>\n                        <td>Episteme</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>ISSN</th>\n                        <td>1742-3600, 1750-0117</td>\n                      </tr>\n                    </table>\n                    <h3 class=\"notes\">Notes:</h3>\n                    <ul class=\"notes\">\n                      <li id=\"item_C6CSEBWY\">\n                        <div>\n                          <p>\n                            Fallis' paper on privacy and lack of knowledge draws\n                            important connections between privacy and the\n                            epistemic world; and provides grounds to challenge\n                            Goldman's suggestion that protecting privacy usually\n                            leads to less knowledge being acquired.\n                          </p>\n                        </div>\n                      </li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <h3 class=\"attachments\">Attachments</h3>\n                    <ul class=\"attachments\">\n                      <li id=\"item_VNSGN3ZW\">\n                        Fallis - 2013 - PRIVACY AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.pdf{\" \"}\n                      </li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </li>\n\n                  <li id=\"item_U6KTGNVY\" class=\"item bookSection\">\n                    <h2>Social Epistemology</h2>\n                    <table>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th>Type</th>\n                        <td>Book Section</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th class=\"author\">Author</th>\n                        <td>Alvin Goldman</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th class=\"author\">Author</th>\n                        <td>Cailin O’Connor</td>\n                      </tr>\n                      <tr>\n                        <th class=\"editor\">Editor</th>\n                        <td>Edward N.

Theemphasis was on evaluating doxastic\n                          attitudes (beliefs and disbeliefs)of individuals in\n                          abstraction from their social environment.\n                          Socialepistemology seeks to redress this imbalance by\n                          investigating theepistemic effects of social\n                          interactions and social systems.

When I\n                joined the team, ; they had developed an effective strategy for\n                matching and introducing members, but still had to onboard,\n                configure and manage the engagements manually. I worked with\n                with the two company founders and another engineer to design and\n                develop a web app that would automate these processes. We\n                divided this core functionality of this into several projects\n                following the agile methodology. Below, is some of the work I\n                did for the first of these projects: \"Match Logic.\"\n\n                Worked with product and development teams to design and develop a web app that would automate the process of matching and introducing members of a community or team. \n              </p>\n\n              <h2 id=\"Artifacts\">Process + Artifacts</h2>\n              <h3 id=\"Artifacts\">Project Spec</h3>\n              <h3 id=\"Artifacts\">Ideation</h3>\n              <p id=\"Artifacts\">\n                After finalizing the design, we began prototyping in Figma.

Using this system as a guide, we created high\n                fidelity mockups of the UI, and after a few rounds of internal\n                feedback,  turned these into functional prototypes in Figma to\n                test with customers.

I\n                worked with him to ensure that the UI was implemented as\n                intended, and that the functionality was as expected. Sticking\n                to the design system, we were able to achieve this relatively\n                quickly. The final product was a fully functional UI that\n                allowed users to configure and manage their match logic, and was\n                later integrated into the rest of the product by the backend\n                team.\n              </p>\n              <h3>Challenges</h3>\n              <p>\n                There were a few aspects of this project that presented\n                challenges. The design decision we spent the most time\n                evaluating was how matching criteria should be ranked/ ordered.\n                Covalent's matching algorithm allows for a criteria to either be\n                required or weighted, and we wanted to allow users to configure\n                this in the UI. This was a bit of a challenge to implement, as\n                we wanted to allow users to drag and drop the criteria to\n                reorder them, but also wanted to allow them to toggle the\n                required/weighted status of each criteria, and both needed to\n                fit into a cohesive UI. We decided to implement this by allowing\n                users to drag and drop the criteria to reorder them, and to\n                toggle the required/weighted status by clicking on the criteria\n                (which would remove it from the weighted section and indicate it\n                is locked/required). This allowed us to keep the UI simple and\n                intuitive, while still allowing users to configure the matching\n                logic as they desired.\n              </p>\n
